# MPhys Project Semester 2
### by Aydin Utting

This repo contains the code I used for my second semester MPhys project.
It has not been edited to be readable or usable to third parties (yet).

You can also read my report `mphys_sem2_report.pdf` to see the results of my work.

Important files are `depth_effective_dimension.py` and its derivative files `clouds_effective_dimension` and `pulsars_effective_dimension`.
These can be run to produce the effective dimension with depth for IRIS, Gaussian Clouds and Pulsars.

Also important are `qnn_train_gaussian` and `pulsars_QNN_train` which were used to when getting loss curves for Gaussian clouds and Pulsars dataset (which we didn't use in the report in the end)

There are also many useful functions (currently) scattered amongst the files for calculating the effective dimension and Fisher.
Best place to look for reproduction are in `clouds_effective_dimension` or `classical_eff_d`
